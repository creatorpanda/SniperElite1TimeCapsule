*If you're searching for the Spotter, you can find its installer [here](https://github.com/creatorpanda/SniperElite1TimeCapsule/tree/main/Installers/Spotter%20For%20Sniper%20Elite%20Installer%201.5.0). It doesn't work. For more information, please [read here](https://github.com/creatorpanda/OverlordForSniperElite1)*.

## SniperElite1TimeCapsule:
- pays tribute to every player who ever made content for the Sniper Elite community,
- was made to keep [player-hosted multiplayer](https://www.gameranger.com/about/) alive and fun,
- serves as eternal storage for every bit of Sniper Elite 1 community-made content I could ever retrieve.

Unlike other pages that store the mods externally, this repository will never be erased, and third parties won't delete the items it stores due to:
- storage size,
- host negligence.
- storing timeouts,
- lack of payments,
- "offensive imagery" (come on, it's a WWII Game).

I always find more and more items to add to this collection for everyone to access for free. If you have items you would like to store up here and ensure their availability and test in time, please [contact me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/creatorpanda) and I will upload your material after thoroughly scanning it.
