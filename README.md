*If you're searching for the Spotter, you can find its installer [here](https://github.com/creatorpanda/SniperElite1TimeCapsule/tree/main/Installers). It doesn't work. For more information, please [read here](https://github.com/creatorpanda/OverlordForSniperElite1)*.

### SniperElite1TimeCapsule:
- pays tribute to every player who ever made content for the Sniper Elite community,
- serves as eternal storage for every bit of Sniper Elite 1 community made content I could ever retrieve,
- was made to keep [player-hosted multiplayer](https://www.gameranger.com/about/) alive and fun.

Unlike other pages that store the mods externally, this repository will never be erased, and the items it stores won't be deleted by third parties due to:
- "offensive imagery",
- lack of payments,
- storing timeouts,
- storage size,
- host negligence.
