Troubleshooting:
----------------

In case of audio problems, try reducing the hardware acceleration on
your sound card. This can be done by opening the Control Panel from
the Start Menu. Double-click on "Sounds And Audio Devices" (this may
be listed as "Sounds and Multimedia" under earlier versions of Windows).
Select Audio and click on the Advanced button in the Sound Playback section.
Click on performance. Drag the slider called Hardware Acceleration towards
the left. Click on Ok. Try reducing the acceleration a step at a time until
the audio problem disappears.


Known Issues:
-------------

1) Issue:
    On some systems with Windows XP and a Creative SoundBlaster Live!
    sound card, there may be occasional sound corruption. The user will hear
    continuous white noise.

   Workaround:
    Set the sound card Hardware Acceleration to "None", as described above.


2) Issue:
    Connecting to an online game often fails with a Network Connection Error.
    Internet gameplay is choppy despite a good internet connection, and
    the player is occasionally dropped from the game.

    Sniper Elite uses UDPLite (Protocol 17) on ports 21540 and 54468.
    These ports may be blocked by home routers with a security firewall.

   Workaround:
    Make sure that these ports are open on any software firewall running
    on your computer, and also ensure that any hardware routers are set
    to allow traffic through these ports.


3) Issue:
    The game crashes or freezes with certain combinations of hardware.

    Systems that have particular motherboards, with the VIA KT266 chipset and
    an AMD processor, may crash or freeze when used with certain graphics cards.

    Workaround:
     There is currently no complete solution to this problem. However, in some
     cases changing the graphics settings in the game may resolve the issue.
